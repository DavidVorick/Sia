					Sia is a new, highly efficient decentralized file storage network that operates using cryptocurrency based compensation.
					Hosts can join Sia, offering their local storage space to consumers in return for compensation.
					Consumers can then rent storage from these hosts by paying with a cryptocurrency.
					<br><br>
					Sia connects many hosts together to store large volumes of data.
					The network has been designed with speed, reliability, and price as the highest priorities.
					To achieve this, data is split up into hundreds of erasure coded pieces and then each piece is stored on a random host in the network.
					The network is self-repairing, such that if any host drops offline the missing piece will be recovered and replaced within a few hours.
					A file will survive even if dozens of hosts drop offline at the same time.
					Having the file in hundreds of places enables massively parallel downloads, like downloading a torrent with hundreds of seeders.
					The throughput on Sia should max out any home connects and also be sufficient for most small and medium businesses.
					<br><br>
					One of the biggest improvements Sia brings to the cloud storage market is the price.
					Currently, 1 TB of high speed and high reliability storage can cost upwards of $20 per month.
					A 1 TB drive costs ~$40 and has an expected lifetime of 18 months.
					Even after electricity, bandwidth, and redundancy, the cost of cloud storage should only be $3-5 per month.
					On Sia, anyone can join the network as a host.
					This completely removes the barrier to entry for hosting data on the cloud, and brings prices to the actual cost of storing data.
					<br><br>
					The other advantage to decentralization is... decentralization.
					Anybody can join the network as a host, anybody can use the network for storing files.
					Every client receives the same service and speed benefits, whether you are renting 5 megabytes or 500 terabytes.
					There is no file discrimination, and there are no corporate deals or favors that occur over the network.
