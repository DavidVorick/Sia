The Bootstrapping Process
1. The new sibling announces its intent to the quorum.
2. The quorum includes the sibling as a "hopeful" in the next heartbeat.
3. During compile, the quorum decides whether or not to add the hopeful, and where.
4. If accepted, the hopeful downloads the current quorum state.
5. The current quorum siblings add the new participant, along with the default heartbeat.
6. The hopeful listens to the quorum and processes any incoming heartbeats.
7. After the next compile, the hopeful becomes a full sibling.
