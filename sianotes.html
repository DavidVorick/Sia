				<b>What are Sianotes?</b>
				<br>
				Sianotes are a temporary asset that are convertible to Siastock upon the completion and launch of Sia.
				Sianotes are available on the Nxt AE, and must be purchased at the market price using Nxt.

				<b>What is Siastock?</b>
				<br>
				The current iteration of Sia operates using two major cryptocurrencies.
				The first is Siacoin, and the second is Siastock.
				Siacoin is the primary currency of Sia, and most transactions on Sia will be using Siacoin.
				For example, storage space must be rented from Sia using Siacoin.
				When storage is rented from Sia, the money goes directly to the hosts.
				A portion of this income is taken as a network fee and distributed among the owners of Siastock.
				The owners of Siastock will have a regular income of siacoins proportional to the total amount of siacoins being directly spent on storage rental.
				<br><br>
				One Sianote can be directly converted to 0.00039% of host income from renting storage, or 10,000 for 3.9% of all host income from storage.
				Currently, there are approximately 1250 sianotes in circulation, or just under 0.5%.
				<br><br>
				<b>Why is there a fee on host income?</b>
				<br>
				Sia is first and foremost a business, and this fee is our source of income.
				Unlike other cryptocurrency businesses, Sia does not get profits through premining the primary currency.
				Instead, we take fees from the network that go directly to the owners of Siastock.
				The developers will own the majority of Siastock.
				This serves multiple purposes.
				The first is that initially, we the developers did not have enough funds to work on Sia full time.
				By selling Siastock, we were able to raise enough money to reject full time employment and start a company instead.
				The second reason is that it gives us a huge income to have a large development force behind Sia.
				Bitcoin is huge, but aside from a small number of core developers, everything that happens around Bitcoin is volunteered, or is driven by companies looking to improve their business model with Bitcoin.
				By giving the Sia team a huge development fund, we will be able to stay cutting edge and be aggressive with our development and marketing.
				Sia's goal is to replace all centralized cloud storage, and that's going to take a lot of money.
				By taking a non-crippling fee (such as 5%), we can fund dozens or potentially hundreds of full time developers and have a marketing budget.
				We fully intend to use Sia as an enterprise product, the same way that Amazon uses S3 as an enterprise product.
				<br><br>
				<b>Legal Disclaimer:</b>
				<br>
				Sianotes have no cash value and are not redeemable for cash.
				Siastock has no cash value as is not redeemable for cash.
				Sianotes do not represent corporate equity.
				Siastock is not corporate equity.
				Sianotes may not be redeemed until the 1.0 launch of Sia.
				Sianotes may not be redeemed on any alpha networks, beta network, or test networks.
				Sia is a product of Nebulous Incorporated.
				The network fee structure is subject to change, however 1 Sianote converts to 0.00039% of host income from renting storage.
