				<b>How can I install Sia?</b>
				<br>
                Sia is being actively developed, and is not yet ready for widespread use.
                However, an unstable alpha version is available for download.
                Currently, Sia is available for Linux only.
                Binaries for other platforms will be available during the beta.
                <br><br>
                Please read the "What's not in the alpha?" section below before downloading.
				<br><br>
                <b>GitHub (recommended):</b>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Clone the repo:<pre>git clone -b release http://github.com/NebulousLabs/Sia && cd Sia</pre></li>
                    <li>Install dependencies:<pre>make dependencies</pre></li>
                    <li>Build Sia: <pre>make</pre></li>
                    <li>Client and server binaries are now installed in Sia/bin/</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <b>Direct download:</b>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Select the appropriate platform:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href=http://23.239.14.98/releases/sia-v0.0.2-linux-x86_64.xz>Linux x86_64</a></li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Extract the tarball: <pre>tar -xvJf sia-v0.0.2-linux-x86_64.xz</pre></li>
                    <li>The client binary and release notes will be extracted to the current directory.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                Since Go compiles binaries statically, this should be compatible across most Linux distributions.
                    Please <a href=https://github.com/NebulousLabs/Sia/issues>let us know</a> if you encounter problems.
                <br><br>
                <b>How do I use the alpha?</b>
		<br>
		Run 'client-cli' to bring up the home menu.
		Type 'h' or 'help' at any menu screen to see what your options are.
		First you need to connect to the network, which you can do by typing 'c'.
		You will be asked to provide a port number to listen on, this is what port your local computer will listen on.
		Then you will be asked to provide a hostname, port number, and ID to connect to.
		Using the values '23.239.14.98', '9989', '1' will connect you to the official Sia test network.
		Alternatively, you can join a different network or create your own.
		When creating your own, you do not need to do the 'connect' step.
		<br><br>
		Once connected to the network, you need a wallet.
		This wallet will be used to pay you for providing storage to the network.
		To get a wallet, type 'g' from the home screen, and put in a wallet ID that you would like to have.
		Your requested ID may already be taken, which means you need to try again with a different ID.
		Creating a wallet will take a few minutes.
		<br><br>
		Once you have a wallet, you are ready to switch to server mode and create a server.
		Switch to server mode by typing 's', and join the network with a new participant by typing 'j' (for join).
		This will ask you to name your server, and to provide a directory for the server.
		Creating a server will take several minutes, perhaps as many as 6.
		There is only room on the official server for 16 participants, it may be full when you try to join.
		This number will be vastly increased in future releases.
		<br><br>
		To do things like upload, download, and send money, you need to load a wallet that you control.
		To do this, go to the home screen (press 'q' if you are on another screen) and type 'l', putting in the wallet you wish to load.
		This will bring you to the wallet menu.
		Type 'h' for a list of available actions.
		<br><br>
		Because it's just a cli, the client is not terribly intuitive.
		We have tried to make the help menus (available by pressing 'h') reasonably useful.
		Please feel free to play around, and remember to file a bug report if something breaks.
		This is an early alpha, things are likely to break.
		Mostly, have fun!
                <br><br>
                <b>What's not in the alpha?</b>
                <br>
                Sia is a complex project with lots of features that are not represented in the alpha.
                You should view this release as a "proof of concept" instead of a usable product.
                <br><br>
                Here are some limitations of the alpha:
                <ul>
                    <li>You must trust the address you use to join a quorum.</li>
                    <li>Multiple quorums are not supported, a maximum of 16 participants can form any single network.</li>
                    <li>The maximum file size is a mere 768kb. This will be vastly increased in the future.</li>
                    <li>You may have trouble joining if you are behind NAT. We are working on this, but you should do manual port-forwarding to join behind NAT. Users with public IP addresses should not have issues.</li>
                </ul>
